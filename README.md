    # Tic Tac Toe Game 
    This project is about simple game Tic Tac Toe. Main objective to achieve is full OOP design,
    with good test coverage.
    ## 1. How to run the project
    ### 1.1 Installation
    
    ``mvn clean install``
    ### 1.2 Testing
    ``mvn test``
    ### 1.3 How to run
    ``mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.tymek.Main"``
    ## 2. Features
    
    ## 3. List of test
    0. Test communication.
    1. Create board of given size (Square).
    2. Board Filed Test.
    3. Test position less than 3.
    4. Test position less than 10.
    5. Test Board.
    6. Test Creating of board.
    7. Test filling board.
    8. Test throwing exception when position is taken.
    9. Test throwing exception when position is out of board.
    10. Test clearing the board.
    11. Test drawing board.
    12. Test player builder.
    13. Test player Score.
    14. Test winning condition, vertical, horizontal, diagonal.
    
 
    ### 4. TO DO 
    1. Ask who start.
    2. Add 3 point when win. One when draw. DONE
    3. Languages.
    4. Server.
    5. Test coverage (Class = 83%, Method = 70%, Line = 57%)
    
    ### 5. Mistakes
    1. Overtrust to my skills (Overdesing).
    2. Restart.
    3. Hard to estimate something, although spend some time making estimation.
    
    
    ### 6. My skills improvemnts
    1. Testing - knowledge about testing streams, exceptions.
    2. IDE - creating live tempalates, debuging and rerunning one testcase when using ``@DataProvider``.
    3. Designing - CRC diagrams, my point of view about design change (for ex. When I am designing, I trying to think 
    about the tests.
    4. Git - branches.
    
    ### 7. Need help
    1. How to test ``Game`` enum. (I think it is impossilbe, only refactor can help, but ask about the advice).
